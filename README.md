This is a wellness app that uses pomodoro timing to mix "real work" and relaxing to helpo with productivity and peace of mind.

This is a new project for me. The technical structure is made with React and ASP.NET backend. I will probably use Microsoft SQL Server for database.

To be honest. I have never touched React and I made a lot of mistakes at the start, even with ChatGPT is helping with some challenges.

Very exited about this.

NOTE:
Will connect web app to a mobile version in short future.
